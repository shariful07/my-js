	<pre>
		Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

		1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

		By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
		find the sum of the even-valued terms.

			fib_x = fib_next;
			fib_next = fib_temp;

			fib_sequence[i] = fib_next;
